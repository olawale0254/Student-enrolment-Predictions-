The explanation of the features
1.Mathematics: this is the olevel course which is between 6 and 0
A1 -6
B2-5
B3-4
C4-3
C5-2
C6-1
D7 below -0
2. English: same as above
3.subject3	: same as above
4.subject4	: same as above
5. subect5	: same as above
SSCEcomposite:  this was computed by adding all the Olevel score and multiplying it by 1/30
Jambcomposite: this was computed by dividing the jamb score by 4
Composite: this was calculated by adding SSCEcomposite and jampcomposite together and dividing it by 2.
Dept: this is the department each student applied for these are
ARTS AND DESIGN':1,

Dptcutoff:  This is the departmental cut off mark
Verdict: this is our target variable and it was mainly computed by setting an hypothesis such that if composite is  ≥ 50 and dptcutoff is ≥ jamb score then the student is admitted else the student is denied admission. 
It is 0- Not admitted
1- addmited
